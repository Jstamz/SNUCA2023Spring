# Image Manipulation in Python

In this phase, we implement two image manipulation algorithms in Python to familiarize ourselves with the algorithms.

You will learn
* how images are represented in a computer system
* how colors and transparency are encoded
* what a convolution is
* how to blur an image using a _n_ x _n_ convolution
* how to alpha blend two images
* how to use fixed-point integer math

### Hand-out

Fork this repository into your namespace and set its visibility to private (this is the default). Read the instructions here carefully. Then clone the lab to your local computer and get to work.
If this is your first time using Git, our [minimal Git Howto](Git.md) will get you started.

### Submission

Commit and push your work frequently to avoid data loss. When you are ready to submit your code for grading, create a tag called "Submission". The timestamp of the "Submission" tag is considered your submission time.

To create a tag, visit the repository on GitLab and navigate to Repository -> Tags. Enter "Submission" as the Tag name then hit "Create tag". You can leave the other fields empty.

If you later discover an error and want to update your submission, you can delete the "Submission" tag, fix your solution, and create a new "Submission" tag. If that happens _after_ the submission deadline, you also need to email the TAs so that they are aware of the update to your submission.

### Coding Rules

In this lab, your work goes into the files `blur_float.py`, `blend_float.py`, `blur_int.py`, and `blend_int.py`. Imports of libraries or modules are not allowed, and you must not change the number of types of parameters passed to, or returned from the functions.

You can modify the other files of the handout to your liking. However, our grading system will only extract and evaluate the four files mentioned above.
